    "article-long": "Hello, I'm Halit. I'm deeply passionate about product design and software engineering, with an ongoing commitment to personal growth in these fields. I recognize the value of continuous learning and creative problem-solving. By merging user-focused design principles with technology, I aim to make people's lives easier. Accessibility and user experience are pillars in my approach to projects. During my university years and beyond, I have gained practical experience by participating in various projects ranging from web development to mobile applications and UI/UX design. Additionally, I am working on launching my new venture. In this journey, I'm sharing what I learn and experience through blog posts and YouTube videos. I believe that teaching as you learn can inspire others too. I also make time for social responsibility projects, as I believe technology can not only benefit individuals but can make a positive impact on society as a whole. If you're interested in freelance projects or collaborative opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm confident that together, we can create something amazing!"
